# Creating a 3-Tier AWS Architecture

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps to set up a 3-tier architecture on AWS Cloud via Terraform . This architecture includes a presentation tier, an application tier, and a data tier.

## Presentation Tier

This tier is responsible for presenting information to users and interacting with them. It typically includes a web server.

### Steps:

1. Launch an EC2 instance for the web server.
2. Configure the necessary security groups and key pairs.
3. Install and configure a web server like Apache or Nginx.
4. Deploy your web application.

## Application Tier

The application tier handles business logic and processes user requests. It may include multiple servers in an auto-scaling group for scalability.

## Data Tier

The data tier stores and manages the application's data. This could be a database server.

### Steps:

1. Launch an RDS instance (or any desired database service).
2. Configure security groups and set up database users.
3. Create the necessary tables and set up data replication or backups.
